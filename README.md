Borwell Software Challenge

This is my entry for the Borwell Software Challenge

It has been coded in the latest version of python (3) 

To run the file all you need is a download of the latest python version https://www.python.org/downloads/

To download the file press the clone or download button then download the ZIP folder and extract it.
Or press on the file you wish to download press RAW right click on the page and press save as.

And then just run the file and you should be good to go

I used a python editor (Idle 3) to run and interact with the code as I find it easier to use.

Hopefully you find this program interesting to look at and works as you expected it would.

Please feel free to email me on calebround@outlook.com if you have an issues running the program.

Finally if you find any bugs either report them on this GitHub Page or email using the address above.
